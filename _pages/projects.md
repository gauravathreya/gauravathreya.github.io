Origins and evolution of endosymbiosis
</font>  </b> 

Eukaryogenesis is the prototypical example of an egalitarian evolutionary transition in individuality, and endosymbiosis, more generally, is central to the origins of many complex biological systems. 
Why do only some symbioses undergo such a transition, and how does the host-symbiont relationship change during this process?
Here, we characterise endosymbiosis by two emergent collective-level properties: host and symbiont survival as a collective (``mutual dependence'') and the level of synchronised reproduction (``reproductive cohesion'').
Using adaptive dynamics, we study the evolution of the traits underlying these properties.
First, by adding a carrying capacity for the host-symbiont collective -- a realism previously ignored -- we find novel reasons why complete dependence or cohesion might not evolve, thus providing further theoretical support for the rarity of transitions in individuality.
Second, our model suggests that asymmetries in evolutionary outcomes of hosts and symbionts can be explained by a difference in their population growth parameters, coupled with the shared fate of the collective they form.
Lastly, we show that there is a characterisation of evolutionary trajectories in the dependence-cohesion plane: we present a robust demonstration that even when investments in dependence and cohesion are uncorrelated, mutual dependence arises faster than reproductive cohesion.
Our results shed light on three aspects of endosymbiosis: coevolution between the host and symbiont, coevolution between dependence and cohesion, and ultimately on the opportunity of undergoing an evolutionary transition.  
Connecting to ecological factors, this work uncovers the fundamental properties of endosymbioses, providing a clear way forward for theoretical and empirical investigations.

Antibiotic-mediated interactions and stability in microbial communities
</font>  </b> 

The coexistence of diverse microbial communities despite the common presence of antimicrobial weapons presents a fundamental puzzle in ecology. 
To address this issue, we investigate the role of antibiotic-mediated interactions in driving microbial diversity using powerful methods from theoretical ecology. 
Our analysis of various interaction graphs involving antibiotic production, resistance, and degradation reveals that a certain producer-sensitive-degrader (PSD) motif in the interaction graph is critical for coexistence. 
We provide mechanistic insights into this motif's importance by presenting exact rules for coexistence in small communities. 
The PSD motif, combined with a cyclic interaction structure, is sufficient for stable coexistence in well-mixed populations. 
Using individual-based simulations, we also explore its role in spatially structured populations and demonstrate that community coexistence is robust over a wide range of antibiotic and degrader diffusivities. 
Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the interaction patterns that drive diversity in complex microbial communities.
Specifically, we emphasize how antagonism does not preclude biodiversity. 
These results offer clear pathways for cultivating synthetic microbial consortia, enabling the design of more effective strategies for manipulating microbial communities.
