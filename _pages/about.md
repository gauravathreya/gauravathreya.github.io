Hi! I'm a theoretical biologist with interests broadly in the areas of evolutionary ecology, complex systems, and the mathematics used in these fields. I am currently a PhD student with [Dr. Hanna Kokko](https://kokkonuts.org/) at the University of Mainz. 

In my work, I have so far focused on two main questions: 1) what are the conditions that lead to the emergence of new levels of individuality?, and 2) which kinds of interaction patterns can lead to co-existence in large ecological communities? 

I think theoretical approaches to these questions - as with many questions in biology - are very powerful due to their ability to both make predictions and enable broad conclusions. More details on my previous work can be found on my [Research](https://gauravathreya.github.io/research/) page. 

You can reach out to me by clicking on any of the icons at the bottom of this page!
