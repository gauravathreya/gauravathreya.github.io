Hi! I'm an undergraduate student in mathematics and biology at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune, India](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/). My academic interests are broadly in the areas of evolutionary theory, complex systems, and the mathematics used in these fields. I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes influence each other, and how they influence the emergence of complexity and diversity in biological systems. I think theoretical approaches to these questions - as with most questions in biology - are very powerful due to their ability to both make predictions and enable broad conclusions. Outside of these fields, I have also enjoyed taking courses on point-set topology and smooth manifolds. 

I am currently an intern with [Dr Chaitanya Gokhale](http://gokhalechaitanya.github.io/) and [Dr Prateek Verma](https://sites.google.com/view/prateekverma) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl&ouml;n, where I am trying to understand mechanisms of maintenance of biodiversity in microbial communities. I am also an [INSPIRE-SHE](https://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme) scholar for the duration of my BS-MS degree (2018-2023). 

Prior to this, I have done a reading project on stochastic processes with [Dr Deepak Dhar](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~ddhar/). I have also worked with [Dr M.S. Madhusudhan](http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/cospi/index.html) on understanding higher-order structure in folded proteins using graph algorithms and methods from computational geometry. More details can be found on the [projects](https://gauravathreya.github.io/projects/) page. 

To unwind, I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, go hiking in the mountains, and learn about languages and history. Feel free to reach out by clicking on any of the icons at the bottom of this page!
