Hi! I am an undergraduate student in mathematics and biology at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune, India](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/). I am also currently an intern with [Dr Chaitanya Gokhale](http://gokhalechaitanya.github.io/) and [Dr Prateek Verma](https://sites.google.com/view/prateekverma) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl&ouml;n, where I am trying to understand mechanisms of production and maintenance of biodiversity in microbial communities. 

My academic interests are primarily in complex systems, evolutionary theory, and the mathematics used in these fields. In particular, I like to think about eco-evolutionary dynamics, innovations in evolution, and how they result in increasing biological complexity. I have also enjoyed taking courses on point-set topology and smooth manifolds. 

Prior to this, I have done a reading project on stochastic processes with [Dr Deepak Dhar](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~ddhar/). I have also worked with [Dr M.S. Madhusudhan](http://cospi.iiserpune.ac.in/cospi/index.html) on understanding higher-order structure in folded proteins using graph algorithms and methods from computational geometry. More details can be found on the [projects](https://gauravathreya.github.io/projects/) page. 

To unwind, I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, go hiking in the mountains, and learn about languages and history. Feel free to reach out by clicking on any of the icons at the bottom of this page!
