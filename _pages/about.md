Hi! I'm a student of mathematics and biology at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune, India](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/). I am currently a master's student with [Dr. Chaitanya S. Gokhale](http://gokhalechaitanya.github.io/) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Pl√∂n, Germany. I am also an [INSPIRE-SHE](https://online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme) scholar for the duration of my BS-MS degree (2018-2023). 

My academic interests are broadly in the areas of evolutionary theory, complex systems, and the mathematics used in these fields. I hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes influence each other, and how they influence the emergence of complexity and diversity in biological systems. More concretely, I am currently interested in two main topics: firstly, what are the conditions that lead to the emergence of new levels of individuality? This is the question addressed by the notion of major transitions in evolution. For my master's thesis, I am working on a model of endosymbiosis, which is - to me at least - the prototypical example of an egalitarian, i.e. between-species, evolutionary transition. Secondly, which kinds of interaction patterns can lead to co-existence in large, complex communities? I have so far focused on microbial communities where strains can inhibit each other by producing (and being resistant to) chemicals that inhibit growth. 

I think theoretical approaches to these questions - as with most questions in biology - are very powerful due to their ability to both make predictions and enable broad conclusions. Outside of these fields, I have also enjoyed taking courses on point-set topology and smooth manifolds. I have previously worked on projects in computational biology, stochastic processes, and (theoretical) microbial ecology and evolution. More details can be found on the [projects](https://gauravathreya.github.io/projects/) page. 

To unwind, I like to play Dungeons and Dragons, go hiking in the mountains, and learn about languages and history. Feel free to reach out by clicking on the icons at the bottom of this page!
